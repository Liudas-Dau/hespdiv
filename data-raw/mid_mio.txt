Range 27 west, township 4 north, Santa Barbara special map, USGS\r\n\r\nArchival typewritten notes at USNM indicate that the “exact locality is between the [original Santa Barbara] lighthouse and Hope Ranch,” and that “[other] parts of the skeleton are still in the bank.” Hope Ranch today is a residential community of approximately 1,600 acres, but in the late 19th century it was a large private property until the Southern Pacific Railroad purchased it for development in January 1876. Actual development on the terrain did not begin until 1923 [52]. It was likely during this period of time between purchase and development that C. A. Roe collected the type specimen (1879–1909), since the property lines of Hope Ranch abutted the original Santa Barbara Lighthouse.\r\nThe original Santa Barbara Lighthouse, however, was destroyed in an earthquake on 29 June 1929 [53], and Kellogg [28]’s published coordinates correspond to a location about 5 km directly south of the original lighthouse, offshore in Santa Barbara Bay. The published locality account by Kellogg [28] corresponds today to sea cliffs located near the property of the current lighthouse [54], which is 100 m northeast of the original lighthouse, at the following coordi- nates (N 34° 23' 44"", W 119° 43' 23""). We argue that this general vicinity, within less than a\r\n100 m radius, likely represents the type locality of Albicetus oxymycterus (Fig 1).

This stratum... probably represents one of the calcareous deposits which alternated with siliceous deposits to form the thick series known as the lower division of the Monterey Formation.\r\n\r\nMinor et al. [55] summarized biostratigraphic findings for lower calcareous unit out- crops of the Monterey Formation in the Santa Barbara Coastal Plain. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages point to Relizian to Saucesian stages, and calcareous nannofossil zones CN1-CN5, with ages generally tending to be younger in the northwestern localities, and older heading to the southeast. For Santa Barbara Point, a locality less than 1 km due east of original Santa Bar- bara Lighthouse, Minor et al. [55] reported benthic foraminiferal assemblages consistent with Relizian and Luisian Stages of Kleinpell [56–57] and calcareous nannofossils of lower middle Miocene zone CN4. These data constrain the age of the type specimen of Albicetus to the early middle Miocene (~16–14 Ma), or Langhian.

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.
