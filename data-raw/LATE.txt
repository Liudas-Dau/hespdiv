Kellogg (1922) said this was early Miocene, but Demere et al. (2005) assign it to the Tortonian; formation and age after Chang & Grimm 1999 (8.2 to 7.3 Ma, Barron, pers. com). Much debate in the literature on the formation name and age of these beds. Others identify the formation as Sisquoc. Behl & Ramirez 2000 agree that the Monterey Formation is exposed in the quarry, but give an age range of 8.5-5.5 Ma (J. Barron, pers. com.)\r\n\r\nDiatom flora corresponds to Rouxia californica Zone of AKIBA (1986), Late Miocene, approximately 7.7-6.4 Ma.  Taminura, Yoshihiro (USNM KEMu database entry date 12 Oct. 2010)\r\n\r\nAccording to the original description, the skull was found by workers of the Celite Products Company quarrying diatomaceous earth, “about 140 feet below the exposed surface of the bed” ([159: 3]). Recent studies focusing on the diatomaceous deposits quarried near Lompoc reported that roughly 218 metres of diatomite, belonging to the upper siliceous member of the Monterey Formation, are exposed at the Celite diatomite quarry [160]. These deposits range from 8.2–7.3 Ma, with the latter date denoting the upper limit of the economically mineable deposits [160]. A similar date is suggested by the diatom assemblage contained in the matrix adhering to the holotype specimen (Rouxia californica Zone/ NPD7A; 7.6–6.6 Ma [161, 162]) [23; N. Kohno 2015, pers. comm.]. Together, these data suggest a latest Tortonian age (7.6–7.3 Ma) for M. miocaena. Note that additional specimens possibly referable to “M.” miocaena have also been reported from the Late Miocene–Pliocene Purisima, San Mateo and San Diego formations (California, USA). Pending further study, these specimens may extend the range of the lineage by up to 5 Ma.

Strontium dates from near the base of the formation range give a best estimate of 6.3 ± 0.3 Ma, whereas samples from the overlying Pico Formation provide a minimum age estimate of 5.2 ± 0.3 or 5.5 ± 0.4 Ma [70].

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.

[130] chemically correlated an ash bed from the basal portion of the Purisima formation below the Crab Marker Bed with similar deposits elsewhere in California, which have been dated to between 5.6–5.0 and 4.7 Ma. However, this estimate is contradicted by the occurrence of the diatom Thalassiosira miocenica, as well as the apparent absence of T. oestrupii, in the Opal Cliff section, implying its assignment to the upper part of subzone b of the Nitzschia reinholdii zone (6.4-5.5 Ma) [128, 130]. Given the absence of direct dating evidence for the ash layer in the basal Purisima Formation, w here assume a lower age boundary of 6.4 Ma for H. bramblei. This is further supported by the occurrence of UCMP 219079 in a similarly aged horizon (based on diatom data) near the bottom of the San Gregorio section north of Santa Cruz [5]. Magnetostratigraphic correlations recognise a depositional hiatus above the Opal Cliff section, lasting from 4.9–3.7 Ma [128, 130]. Taken together, these observations imply an age range of 6.4–4.9 Ma.

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.

Marx and Fordyce follow Case (1904) in suggesting that Metopocetus durinasus is from the St Marys Formation, but this seems unsubstantiated. Kellogg (1968) clearly states that this fossil is from Nomini Cliffs, which only exposes Zones 14-16, which are Langhian in age.\r\n\r\nUSNM 8518 was collected from “a Miocene marl from near the mouth of the Potomac river” [90: 143]. Subsequent authors interpreted this description of the type locality to refer to either the Calvert Formation [93, 163] or the St. Marys Formation [164], implying either a Langhian or a Serravallian age, respectively. To date, no other cetotheriid remains from the Calvert Formation have been described, but at least two cetotheriids (Cephalotropis coronatus and “Cetotherium” megalophysum; see above) occur in the Little Cove Point Member of the St Marys Formation. This, together with the fact that the suggestion of the St Marys formation as a potential source unit was published just eight years after the original description of the species, might support the origin of M. durinasus from the Little Cove Point Member. The latter has been strontium dated to the early Tortonian (11.7–10.0 Ma) [48, 49], which is the age assumed here pending the emergence of better-constrained occurrence data.

Kellogg (1922) said this was early Miocene, but Demere et al. (2005) assign it to the Tortonian; formation and age after Chang & Grimm 1999 (8.2 to 7.3 Ma, Barron, pers. com). Much debate in the literature on the formation name and age of these beds. Others identify the formation as Sisquoc. Behl & Ramirez 2000 agree that the Monterey Formation is exposed in the quarry, but give an age range of 8.5-5.5 Ma (J. Barron, pers. com.)\r\n\r\nDiatom flora corresponds to Rouxia californica Zone of AKIBA (1986), Late Miocene, approximately 7.7-6.4 Ma.  Taminura, Yoshihiro (USNM KEMu database entry date 12 Oct. 2010)\r\n\r\nAccording to the original description, the skull was found by workers of the Celite Products Company quarrying diatomaceous earth, “about 140 feet below the exposed surface of the bed” ([159: 3]). Recent studies focusing on the diatomaceous deposits quarried near Lompoc reported that roughly 218 metres of diatomite, belonging to the upper siliceous member of the Monterey Formation, are exposed at the Celite diatomite quarry [160]. These deposits range from 8.2–7.3 Ma, with the latter date denoting the upper limit of the economically mineable deposits [160]. A similar date is suggested by the diatom assemblage contained in the matrix adhering to the holotype specimen (Rouxia californica Zone/ NPD7A; 7.6–6.6 Ma [161, 162]) [23; N. Kohno 2015, pers. comm.]. Together, these data suggest a latest Tortonian age (7.6–7.3 Ma) for M. miocaena. Note that additional specimens possibly referable to “M.” miocaena have also been reported from the Late Miocene–Pliocene Purisima, San Mateo and San Diego formations (California, USA).

These deposits range from 8.2–7.3 Ma, with the latter date denoting the upper limit of the economically mineable deposits [160]. A similar date is suggested by the diatom assemblage contained in the matrix adhering to the holotype specimen (Rouxia californica Zone/ NPD7A; 7.6–6.6 Ma [161, 162]) [23; N.

Fossils from this locality are concentrated in small pockets along the bedding plane. Stratigraphically, locality LACM 3776 is bracketed by two volcanic ashes, Ash 15 (fission-track dated 8.4 ± 1.4 Ma) and Ash 16 (K/Ar dated at 8.50 ± 0.13 Ma) (Whistler, 1969; Burbank and Whistler, 1987; Whistler, 1991; Whistler and Burbank, 1992). Ashes 15 and 16 are separated by 258 m of strata in the vicinity of locality LACM 3776, and the locality is 123 m below Ash 16. Locality LACM 3776 falls within a paleomagnetically reversed zone that can be correlated to the paleomagnetic Chron C4Ar.1n, which has a revised age range of 9.230–9.308 Ma (Cande and Kent, 1995). Ash 16 falls within a normal magnetic interval that can be correlated to paleomagnetic Chron C4An with a revised age range of 8.699–9.025 Ma (Cande and Kent, 1995), consistent with the K/Ar date presented by Whistler and Burbank (1992). These magnetic correlations suggest that the fission-track date of 8.4 ± 1.8 Ma for Ash 15 presented by Whis- tler and Burbank (1992) is anomalously young. Thus, the best estimate of age for locality LACM 3776 is between 9.2 and 9.3 Ma (early late Miocene).","The type was collected from a light tan siliceous sandy mudstone in the upper part of the Dove Spring Formation.
