# Installing HespDiv

The official CRAN version of „HespDiv“ can be installed using: install.packages('HespDiv'). However, more up-to-date version of the package can be found on the GitHub. You can install it using „devtolls“ package: devtools::install_github("Liudas-Dau/HespDiv"). As new updates can cause some unexpected package behaviour, use the GitHub version with caution.
